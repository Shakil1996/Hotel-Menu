Test Grid Of Program

Test 1	To show me how many rooms are available at the start of the program.	
Once I have open to program it should start from 'room 0  is available' all the way to room 9.	

Initialise
Room 0 is Empty
Room 1 is Empty
Room 2 is Empty
Room 3 is Empty
Room 4 is Empty
Room 5 is Empty
Room 6 is Empty
Room 7 is Empty
Room 8 is Empty
Room 9 is Empty	

In the Actual results the program has displayed to me that the rooms from 0 to 9 are all 
empty therefore this test is successful.

+20% A reasonable attempt at Add, View, Edit, and Delete using menu options


Test 2	To give me the open to add, view, edit or delete rooms by using the menu options.	
So once the program has initialised the rooms I should be able to see the menu option.	

Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
Enter F to Find Room
Enter Z to Exit Program	

So once the program has initialised the rooms for me, I was able to see the menu 
option therefore this test is successful.


Test 3	To allow me to add a customer into the system.	
Once I enter 'A', the program should then ask question based on the room 
such as the room number and guest name.	

Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
Enter F to Find Room
Enter Z to Exit Program
A
Enter A Room Number Between 0 - 9
1
Enter The Name For That  Room  Number 1 :
Shakil
Room 0 is Empty
Room 2 is Empty	

So when I have entered 'A' I was given the option to select a room number between 0 - 9, 
so I entered '1' for the room number. After that I was told to name that room, So I have given a name. 
So now it shows that Room 0 and jumps to Room 2 are empty therefore Room 1 is being used by that name 
meaning that this test is success.


Test 4	
This test should allow me to see all of the rooms whether or not they are occupied or not.	
So the expected result should be that when I enter the letter 'V' into the current program running, 
it should display me that room 1 is being used by 'Shakil' and the remaining room should be empty. 
	
Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
Enter F to Find Room
Enter Z to Exit Program
V
Room 0 Occupied By: e
Room 1 Occupied By: Shakil
Room 2 Occupied By: e
Room 3 Occupied By: e
Room 4 Occupied By: e
Room 5 Occupied By: e
Room 6 Occupied By: e
Room 7 Occupied By: e
Room 8 Occupied By: e
Room 9 Occupied By: e	

The actual results display that once the letter 'V' was entered to the program, it has 
displayed all the program that the program has and it tells me that rooms Occupied by e 
are empty and Room 1 is being used by 'Shakil' therefore this test was successful.


Test 5	This test should allow me to edit any of the rooms I wish to edit by entering 'E' 
into the program.	
So the expected results should be that once I have Entered the letter 'E' 
it should allow me to select which room information I want to change, and give it a new name.	

Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
Enter F to Find Room
Enter Z to Exit Program
E
Enter A Room Number Between 0 - 9 That You Want To Change
1
Enter The New Name For That  Room  Number 1 :
Mohammed
Room 0 is Empty
Room 2 is Empty	

When I have entered the letter 'E' the program has asked me to select 
a number between room 0 - 9 that I want to change, so I have pick '1' since 'Shakil' was 
using this room. After that the program has asked me to add a new name for this room, 
which then stored that new name into room 1 therefore test for this was successful.


Test 6	This test should allow me to delete any of the information that was stored in 
that rooms, therefore by entering the letter 'D' I should be able to erase the information in that room.	
So the Expected result should be that once I have entered the letter 'D', the program should ask 
me which room I wish to delete, and once I select that room, the room should be empty.	

Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
Enter F to Find Room
Enter Z to Exit Program
D
Enter A Room Number Between 0 - 9
1
Room 0 is Empty
Room 1 is Empty
Room 2 is Empty	

When I have entered the letter 'D' to delete a room, the program has 
asked me to select a room that I wish to delete, so knowing that room 
1 was stored with information, I have selected that room, so the end result 
was that Room 1 is Empty therefore this test was successful.

+10% Implement the ‘Find’ option.


Test 7	This test should allow me to find any room that I want. Also with this, 
it should display me the information that is stored within this room.	
So the Expected result should be that once I have entered the letter 'F' 
the program will then ask me a question to select which room do I want to see. 
So once I have selected the room number, it should tell me whether or not the 
room is occupied or not.
	
Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
Enter F to Find Room
Enter Z to Exit Program
F

When I have entered the letter 'F' to find a room, the program 
did ask me to select a number between 0 - 9, so once I have selected a number, it has 
displayed to me that the rooms information of the number I selected, therefore this test 
was successful.


Test 8	This test Should allow me to Exit the program but Entering 'Z' into the program.	
So the Expected result should be that once I enter 'Z' the program should 
tell me that the program has been shut down.	

Enter A to Add Room for Guest
Enter V to View all Rooms
Enter E to Edit Room
Enter D to Delete Room
